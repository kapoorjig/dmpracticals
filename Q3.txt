using namespace std;

int main()
{
 int s = open("P1",0);
 if(s==-1)
 cout<<"the source file is not opened"<<endl;
 if(s>0)
 cout<<"the source file has opened"<<endl;
 int d = open("new",1);
 if(d==-1)
 cout<<"the destination file has not opened"<<endl;
 if(d>0)
 cout<<"the destination file has opened"<<endl;
 char temp[50];
 char c=1;
 while(c>0)
{
 c = read(s,temp,sizeof(temp));
 write(d,temp,c);
 }cout<<"copying complete!"<<endl;
close(s);
close(d);
